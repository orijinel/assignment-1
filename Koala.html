      Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their laid-back demeanor. These tree-dwelling mammals feed on eucalyptus leaves, which is most of their diet. Despite their bear-like appearance, koalas are not bears but are marsupials that carry their young in pouches. Koalas are currently facing threats from habitat loss, disease, and climate change, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.
